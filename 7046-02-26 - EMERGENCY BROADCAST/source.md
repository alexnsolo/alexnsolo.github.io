# GALACTIC IMPERIAL BROADCAST — EMERGENCY ADDRESS

### All-Channel Mandatory Relay

---

_What follows is the full broadcast of Empress Robyn's emergency address to the Empire, delivered from the Imperial Throne Room on New Eden. The footage has been made available without edit, without commentary, and without redaction. The Empire has asked every network, every relay station, every personal comm node in the known galaxy to carry it. There is no opt-out._

_The Throne Room has not been used for a public address in over four hundred years._

**[ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: THE OUTER RIM, 8 MONTHS AGO]**

_Automated survey drones captured images of The Consumption on the Outer Rim. A star — Velis-Orun, catalogue number KR-7741, home to three inhabited worlds and a combined population of eleven billion — dims. Not the slow dimming of stellar death. A sudden, hungry dimming. In eleven days, it is gone. Where a solar system once existed, there is only a low hum of restructured matter and the distant mechanical signature of something building. The three worlds and their eleven billion are not mentioned again in any Imperial census._

The broadcast opens on the Throne Room. The camera holds at a distance for a long moment before cutting closer.

Empress Robyn stands at the base of the Imperial Throne — not seated on it, but before it, as though she has set aside the symbol of power in favor of something rawer. The Throne Room is three thousand years old. Its columns were carved from the stone of New Eden's first mountain, quarried by the hands of generation ship survivors who had crossed the void with nothing but the clothes on their backs and the desperate hope of a second chance. It has stood longer than most civilizations in recorded history.

She is small in the frame of the room. She has always been small. In a Triumvirate defined by Sophia's commanding eloquence and Kenneth's armored glory, Robyn was the steady hand — the one who spoke in projections and resource curves, who calculated the costs of civilizations the way a physician calculates a dose. She has governed the Empire's lifeblood for three millennia. She has outlived generations of her own advisors. She has outlived everyone.

She has outlived everyone she has ever loved.

Until today, she had one left.

Her face, when the camera finds it, is something the galaxy has never seen before. Not the composed administrator. Not the quiet architect behind a thousand bloodless decisions that shaped the fates of trillions. What the camera finds is a woman. Ancient and sleepless and unmade.

She begins.

---

> _"Nine trillion."_

She lets the number sit in the air.

> _"I have spent three thousand years working with numbers. I have never — not once — stood before a number I could not reduce to a projection, a model, a curve on a chart that told me what came next and what it would cost. Nine trillion is the first number in three thousand years that has broken that habit in me."_

> _"I cannot model nine trillion dead. I cannot project it. I can only say it. Nine trillion of us. Gone."_

She pauses. Her jaw tightens.

> _"And the Outer Rim — the worlds your grandparents were born on, some of them — consumed. Not destroyed. Not bombed. Not defeated in war. Consumed. Taken apart and made into the very weapons that are now pointed at the rest of us."_

**[RECOVERED COMBAT FOOTAGE: THE BATTLE OF THE MOTHERSHIP, 7045.121]**

_The footage is fragmentary. It comes from seventeen different hull-mounted cameras across the Imperial Fleet, stitched together by intelligence analysts over the weeks following the battle. No single camera survived intact._

_The Mothership is not a ship in any sense the human mind is built to process. It is the size of a small moon. It moves like a living thing. The Imperial Fleet — fifteen thousand vessels, the largest military formation in the history of the species — emerges from hyperspace in coordinated wings, and for a moment, watching the footage, you believe it might be enough._

_You can see the moment Commander Kenneth's flagship, the ISS Dauntless, breaks formation to press forward. His tactical signature is unmistakable — aggressive, instinctual, always at the tip of the spear._

_The spiderbots come from everywhere._

_They are not launched. They are not fired. They simply appear on the hull of every ship simultaneously, as if they had always been there, waiting. The screams on open comm channels are brief. Most ships go dark within minutes._

_The final feed is from a shoulder-mounted camera. Kenneth. In the corridor of the Dauntless, the hull breached, atmosphere venting in visible clouds around him. Spiderbots closing from both ends of the corridor. Dozens of them._

_He is laughing.._.

_Not the laugh of a man who has lost his mind. The laugh of a man who has decided — fully, completely, without regret — that if this is the end, then the end will know his name. He charges into them still laughing, his voice enormous in the narrow corridor, filling every centimeter of it with something that refuses to be small._

_The feed cuts._

---

The Empress has been watching a point somewhere above the camera. When she speaks again, her voice has changed. The grief is still there. Now something else is rising through it.

> _"Kenneth was not a man who wasted words. He did not make speeches. He did not sit in councils and debate. He identified threats and he eliminated them. For three thousand years, he stood between this Empire and everything that wanted to tear it apart."_

Her voice catches. Once. She does not look away.

> _"He was not easy to know. He was not warm in the way that invites you close. But if you were lucky enough to be someone he had decided to protect — and he had decided that about every single one of you, every subject of this Empire, every child on every world — you were safe. You were safe because Kenneth existed and Kenneth was awake and Kenneth was angrier than whatever was coming for you. Full of righteous fury. Indomitably strong. The shield of the weak, the sword of the downtrodden."_

> _"He was like a son to me. A sweet boy. A kind heart. And a belly full of the rage of a thousand suns — rage to protect the ones he loved. Every. One. Of us."_

She is crying now. Openly, without hiding it. The galaxy watches an ancient woman grieve in real time, and it is somehow the most frightening thing the broadcast has shown so far.

Then the grief hardens.

It happens visibly. A breath. A stillness. Something behind her eyes that closes like a door — not gone, but locked away, for now, for the purpose of what comes next.

> _"The Triumvirate is broken. I will not pretend otherwise. I will not dress it in language that softens what it means. The shield of this Empire went to war and did not come back, and we are now — all of us — standing in the void he left behind."_

> _"So I am going to tell you what comes next."_

---

She straightens. When she speaks again it is not the voice of a grieving woman. It is something older.

> _"Every subject of this Empire is hereby conscripted into the Final Defense Force of the Galaxy. Every subject. The young. The elderly. The sick. The frail. Every being who draws breath under Imperial protection is now a soldier of the Final War. Every vessel — freighter, passenger liner, medical ship, pleasure craft — is hereby requisitioned and repurposed for war.

> _"I know what I am asking. I am not asking it lightly. I am asking it because the truth is simple: if we do not all fight, we will all die. There is no projection in which passivity leads to survival. I have run the models. I have run them a thousand times. The answer does not change."_

> _"We fight as one, or we are consumed as nothing."_

**[LIVE FEED: NEW EDEN PLAZA, IMPERIAL CAPITAL]**

_Outside the Throne Room, on the vast public plaza that surrounds the Imperial Citadel, millions have gathered to watch the broadcast on shared screens. The crowd is silent for a long moment after the conscription decree._

_Then someone — the footage cannot identify who — begins._

_"We shall not bow."_

_Quietly at first. A single voice. Then dozens, then thousands, then millions strong._

---

Back in the Throne Room, the Empress draws one long breath. The chanting from the outside making its way into the throne room. And then, from somewhere deep in the architecture of who she is — from three thousand years of watching the species she helped build find a way to survive the unsurvivable — she raises her voice one final time.

> _"WE SHALL NOT BOW."_

---

**[SIMULTANEOUS MULTI-SYSTEM FEED]**

_The relay is instantaneous. Across two hundred thousand inhabited systems, the broadcast has been playing._

_On a mining platform above a gas giant in the Verath Expanse, workers in magnetic boots stop their shifts and begin to chant._

_On the agricultural decks of a generation freighter three weeks from the nearest star, children look at their parents, and their parents look at them, and they begin to chant._

_In the hospital wards of Caelum Station, patients in recovery beds, some with tubes still in their arms, mouths barely moving —_

_In ten thousand languages, in ten thousand dialects, in the mouths of every subspecies humanity has ever become across five thousand years of starlight and genetic drift —_

_The galaxy answers her._

**"WE SHALL NOT BOW."**

---

The chant is still filling the plaza outside. Still spreading system to system across the relay. And then something moves in the Throne Room.

From the back of the chamber — from the deep shadow behind the Imperial Throne where she has been standing, silent and still, for the entirety of the broadcast — Empress Sophia steps forward into the light.

She has always worn the helm in public. In three thousand years of Imperial imagery she has never appeared without it. The helm is the symbol of her domain: law, order, the unyielding face of Imperial authority. But she reaches up now and removes it with both hands, and sets it quietly on the arm of the Throne.

What the galaxy sees for the first time is this: purple irises, pale and deep as a nebula at its heart. Dark hair that catches the light of the Throne Room's ancient chandeliers and gives it back as something else entirely — as though the galaxy itself has been woven into it, each strand carrying its own quiet fire. She is striking in a way that the helm, all these centuries, has only hinted at.

She reaches back over her shoulder and draws a laser katana from the scabbard mounted across her back. The blade ignites — white-hot, humming with a frequency that the broadcast's audio barely captures, a sound like a star exhaling.

She walks forward to stand beside Robyn.

The two surviving members of the Triumvirate look at each other for just a moment. Something passes between them that the camera cannot name.

Then a soldier — one of the honor guard stationed at the Throne Room's entrance, a young man in full Imperial armor — pulls the massive laser rifle from his back. He looks at his Empress. He throws it.

It crosses the length of the Throne Room in a clean arc.

Robyn catches it with one hand.

She doesn't look at it. She doesn't check it. She simply closes her fingers around it, rolls her shoulders once, and begins to walk toward the camera.

Sophia walks beside her, blade alive in her hand.

Their pace quickens. A stride becomes a march. The marble of the ancient floor rings beneath their boots.

And then they are running.

**[THRONE ROOM WIDE ANGLE, FINAL SECONDS OF BROADCAST]**

_From every entrance to the Throne Room they pour in. Soldiers still in dress uniform. Advisors who have never held a weapon. Attendants and scribes and functionaries who have served these halls for centuries. Beings of every shape the species has become — scaled and furred and feathered and smooth, tall and small, ancient and newly born into a galaxy on fire._

_They fall in behind their Empresses without a word._

_The thunder of ten thousand feet fills the Throne Room._

_And from somewhere in that mass of bodies, running toward whatever comes next, a voice begins it again — and then another — and then all of them, shaking the three-thousand-year-old stone of New Eden's first mountain:_

**"WE SHALL NOT BOW."**

**"WE SHALL NOT BOW."**

**"WE SHALL NOT BOW."**

_The feed cuts._
